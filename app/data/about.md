#### Intro
Hi. I'm Ryan, a software engineer living in Jefferson City Missouri, who enjoys building things that live on the internet and on your desktop. I have 6 years experience as a software engineer and 2 years as an software engineering team lead. I'm a hands-on technical leader who has built software products from the ground up, run engineering teams, and provided guidance at the director level.

#### Currently
At the Missouri Gaming Commission I have learned how to build effective engineering teams and manage people. Coming from a position building web apps, I expanded my knowledge of building secure, always available web applications. I've also learned how to build and maintain large Windows desktop applications.
